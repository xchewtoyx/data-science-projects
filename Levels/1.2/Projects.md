#### Semester 2: Data Structures, Linear Independence, and Simple Inference

| Project Idea | Core Pillars Demonstrated | Description & Source Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Pandas Data Cleaning and Munging** | Python/DS, Stats | Load a complex, unstructured dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, then apply methods for detecting and handling missing values (`isnull()`, `dropna()`, `fillna()`), removing duplicate records, and renaming columns, documenting the wrangling process [30-33]. |
| **2. Linear Independence Tester** | LA, Python | Write a program to test whether a given set of vectors is linearly independent by finding the nullspace solution to the equation $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$. If multiple solutions exist, the columns are dependent [34, 35]. |
| **3. Linear Regression Model (Statsmodels)** | Stats, Python/DS | Fit a multiple linear regression model using `statsmodels` (or `scikit-learn` for prediction focus) to predict a quantitative response variable. Report on the statistical significance (p-values) of the predictors and interpret the $\text{R}^2$ value for goodness of fit [36-39]. |
| **4. Differentiation Rule Implementation** | Calculus, Python | Implement the basic rules of differentiation (sum, product, and quotient rules) in a rudimentary Python program (or symbolic math library) to find the derivative of composed functions [40-42]. |
| **5. Sampling Distribution Demonstration** | Stats, Python | Write a program to simulate the sampling distribution of the sample mean ($\bar{x}$) for a non-normal parent population, demonstrating how the distribution approaches the Normal distribution as sample size increases, confirming the Central Limit Theorem [43-45]. |
| **6. Single-Variable Optimization** | Calculus, Python | Implement a numerical method (like a simple search algorithm or rudimentary gradient descent approach for univariate functions) to find the local minimum or maximum of a specified function, utilizing the concept that the derivative is zero at extrema [46, 47]. |
| **7. Matrix Inverse/Factorization using LU** | LA, Python | Use NumPy to find the LU decomposition of a matrix [48]. Use this decomposition to efficiently solve a system of linear equations, demonstrating the computational utility of matrix factorization [48, 49]. |
| **8. Data Visualization with Matplotlib/Seaborn** | Python/DS | Create informative visualizations (scatterplots, bar charts, boxplots) using Matplotlib and Seaborn for data exploration and reporting, applying appropriate labeling and annotation techniques [50-52]. |
