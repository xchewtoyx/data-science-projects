#### Semester 7: Unsupervised Learning, Ensemble Methods, and Complexity

| Project Idea | Core Pillars Demonstrated | Description & Source Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Clustering Analysis and Interpretation** | ML/DS, Stats, Python | Apply and compare $K$-means clustering and Hierarchical Clustering to a multi-feature dataset. Use methods (like the elbow method) to justify the choice of $K$ and interpret the resulting clusters in terms of the original variables [59, 133-135]. |
| **2. Decision Trees and Random Forests** | ML/DS, Python | Use ensemble methods (Random Forests or Gradient Boosting) to solve a regression or classification task. Analyze the model results to determine feature importance, contrasting the performance with a single decision tree [136-139]. |
| **3. Complex Dynamic Programming Solution** | Algorithms, Python | Implement a full dynamic programming solution to a classic problem like the Knapsack Problem or RNA secondary structure prediction, demonstrating optimization over sequences or structures [125, 140]. |
| **4. Advanced Correlation Analysis** | Stats, Python | Investigate non-linear correlation in a dataset by modeling relationships using regression splines (e.g., natural splines) or Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), comparing this to linear correlation measures [92, 136]. |
| **5. Model Selection via Stepwise Regression** | Stats, Python | Use forward or backward stepwise selection to identify a satisfactory subset of predictors for a linear model on the training set, comparing the resulting test error with a full least squares model [141-143]. |
| **6. Nonparametric Hypothesis Testing** | Stats, Python | Implement a nonparametric test (e.g., sign test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) appropriate for data that violates the assumptions of parametric tests (like normality), discussing when these alternatives are necessary [61, 91]. |
| **7. Large-Scale Data Wrangling Simulation** | Python/DS | Design a data pipeline simulating a large-scale process (e.g., word count using MapReduce concepts or large file processing), focusing on efficient memory management and optimized NumPy/Pandas techniques [144, 145]. |
| **8. Local Search Heuristics** | Algorithms, Python | Implement a local search heuristic (e.g., Metropolis algorithm or Simulated Annealing) to find an approximate solution to a known NP-hard problem like Maximum Cut, acknowledging that provable guarantees may not exist [140, 146]. |
