#### Semester 9: Capstone and Professional Practice

| Project Idea | Core Pillars Demonstrated | Description & Source Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. End-to-End Data Science Capstone** | All Pillars | Execute a complete, end-to-end data science project on a substantial real-world dataset (e.g., from marketing, finance, or biology [60]). This includes data acquisition, cleaning, feature engineering, comparative modeling (LR, SVM, RF), model validation, test error reporting, and a final inference/prediction report [162, 163]. |
| **2. Robust Statistics and Outlier Analysis** | Stats, Python | Conduct a study focusing on the impact of outliers or contamination on statistical estimates (e.g., mean and variance). Implement robust estimation techniques (like median or IQR-based methods) and compare their stability against classical estimators [164, 165]. |
| **3. Deep Learning Overfitting and Regularization** | DL, Stats, Python | Experiment with training a deep neural network until zero training error (interpolation) is achieved. Apply regularization techniques (e.g., ridge penalty or dropout) and early stopping using SGD to mitigate overfitting, comparing test set performance in each case [130, 166-168]. |
| **4. Statistical Learning Theory Exploration** | Stats, ML | Provide a theoretical review and practical exploration of the concepts of bias-variance tradeoff and the curse of dimensionality, illustrating these effects using appropriate simulated data and modeling examples [169-171]. |
| **5. Web Scraping and Data Acquisition Pipeline** | Python/DS | Build a functional Python script to scrape data from a structured source online, store the results efficiently (e.g., JSON or Parquet), and integrate the raw, acquired data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis [31, 172-174]. |
| **6. Collaborative Filtering Recommender System** | ML/DS, LA, Python | Build a simple item-based or user-based collaborative filtering system using techniques like matrix factorization, demonstrating its use in suggesting relevant items or connections to users [135, 175]. |
| **7. Advanced Time Series Modeling (RNN/AR)** | DL, Stats, Python | Apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or autoregressive models to forecast future values of a time series, comparing performance and complexity against simpler linear models [151]. |
| **8. Comparative Convex/Non-Convex Solver** | Optimization, LA | Compare the difficulty and efficiency of solving a typical convex problem (e.g., standard Least Squares) versus a known non-convex optimization problem (e.g., a simple global optimization case), discussing the theoretical guarantees available for each [71, 128]. |
