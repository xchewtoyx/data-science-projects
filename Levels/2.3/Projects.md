#### Semester 6: Convexity, Algorithms, and Intermediate ML

| Project Idea | Core Pillars Demonstrated | Description & Source Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Linear Programming (LP) Application** | LA, Optimization | Formulate a real-world resource allocation or scheduling problem (e.g., airline scheduling, portfolio optimization basics) as a Linear Program, defining the objective function and constraints. Use a Python solver to find the optimal solution [71, 117-119]. |
| **2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** | LA, ML, Python | Implement PCA using $\mathbf{scikit}$-learn on a multi-dimensional dataset to reduce its dimensionality. Relate the principal components found to the singular vectors obtained from the SVD or eigenvectors of the covariance matrix [59, 120-122]. |
| **3. Logistic Regression and ROC Analysis** | Stats, ML/DS, Python | Implement Logistic Regression for a binary classification task. Evaluate performance using metrics relevant to classification (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall) and generate an ROC curve [34, 123]. |
| **4. Intro to Dynamic Programming** | Algorithms, Python | Solve a foundational problem (e.g., finding the longest common subsequence or the minimum cost path in a grid) using the dynamic programming paradigm, emphasizing the storage and reuse of solutions to subproblems [124, 125]. |
| **5. Nonparametric Distribution Estimation** | Stats, Python | Estimate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) or probability density function (PDF) of a dataset using nonparametric methods (e.g., empirical CDF or simple kernel density estimation), comparing the results to parametric assumptions [126, 127]. |
| **6. Quadratic Optimization Problem** | LA, Optimization | Formulate and solve a simple quadratic optimization problem (which is convex) subject to linear constraints, demonstrating the power of solving convex problems efficiently [71, 128]. |
| **7. Dimensionality Reduction Visualization** | LA, ML, Python | Apply PCA or manifold learning techniques to a complex dataset (e.g., image data or a feature set with many variables). Visualize the resulting lower-dimensional data structure, using Python for the implementation and visualization [120, 121]. |
| **8. Regression Model Regularization** | ML/DS, Stats, Python | Apply regularization techniques (Lasso or Ridge regression) to a linear model using $\mathbf{scikit}$-learn. Use cross-validation to tune the penalty parameter $\lambda$ and discuss how regularization combats overfitting [59, 129, 130]. |
