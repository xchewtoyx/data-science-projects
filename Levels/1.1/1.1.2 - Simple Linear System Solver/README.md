# Simple Linear System Solver

| LA, Python | 

Write a Python program to solve a $3 \times 3$ system of linear equations ($\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$) using an explicit implementation of Gaussian elimination (Elementary Row Operations) and back substitution, demonstrating the direct solution method
